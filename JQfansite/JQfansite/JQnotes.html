	<!--jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that does more with less code

	<!--body.Onload() will be called after things like images are 
	loaded, but document.ready() wont wait for things 
	like images to get loaded.
	
	<!--It makes it easier to use JavaScript by taking a lot of common tasks that 
	require more JavaScript to accomplish and putting them into methods that 
	that only need one line of code.
	
	<!--selectors let you change HTML elements
		like ids in in different tags
		or tags themselves, like p or img
	
	<!--it's light, it has a lot of plugins to better customize
	and it's relatively easy since it's similar to CSS
	
	<!--jQuery can do what javascript does but with a lot less code
	-->
